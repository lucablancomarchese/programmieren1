### Program that saves encrypted notes in a file.


**What we have:**
We have a Programm that let you choose two operations:
1. Write a Note
	- *Let you write a note and encrypts the note in your own choosing shift value.*
2. Exit
	- *Finished the program.*



**What's to do?**
Implementing of two methods:
1. writeToFile(String filename, String text)
	- Method takes the name and overwrite the file with the written text.
	- Edit the main method that user can choose a file.
2. readAFile(String filename)
	- User should be able to read a file.

Extending the user interface:
- Adjusting the option "1. Write a Note", that the user can save the note in any file.
- Adding a second option "2. Read from File" that the user can read the text from a file.
